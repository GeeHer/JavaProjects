What is Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
    It's simply a way of writing code. Some rules that we follow. There are other ways as well like
    functional programming, procedural programming.

There are four main pillars of OOP
    1)Inheritance
    2)Polymorphism
    3)Abstraction
    4)Encapsulation

Why should we learn OOP:
    1) Code re-usability
    2) It's easier to write large amounts of code
    3) Sharing code with others becomes easier
    4) Security of the code is increased.
    5) Changing code becomes easier.

Object:
    An object is something that we can physically touch . Everything around us like chairs, tables, computer etc.
    They are all objects. We can easily represent all these objects inside our computers by telling a computer
    what an object looks like and how it behaves.

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.

String class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers
    are processed in this form. String is the most widely used class in all of Java.

Creating objects from String class.
