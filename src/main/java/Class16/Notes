Constructors:
    Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way. We can also put any
    piece of code that we want to execute when the object of a class is created.

Why should we use Constructors?
    1) They help us write more secure classes.
    2) Cleaner code
    3) More control over the values that we can assign to the instance fields.

Syntax:
    1) No return type, not even void
    2) Same name as class name
    3) Usually public access modifier
    4) Parameters
    5) Body of the constructor
