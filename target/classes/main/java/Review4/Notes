Nested Loops:
    A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Nested loops are used to solve complex problems in which
    we have nested data or need to perform nested iterations. We can nest a for loop inside a while loop
    or a for loop inside another for loop.

Why Nested Loops:
    As a tester we will be needing them to read excel data.
    We will be needing them to go through multiple pages and
    from each page we might want to go through multiple items.

Syntax:
    for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
      for(int j=0;j<10;j++){
      }
    }

Arrays:
    Arrays help us store multiple objects of the same type in just one variable. They are index based data structures.
    Every item that we store inside an array is assigned a number. That number is called an index. Whenever we want
    to get any value from the array we provide that index.

Why should we use arrays:
