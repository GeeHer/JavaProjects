Type Casting:
    Type casting is converting data from one datatype to another datatype.
    For example we can convert an integer into a float or other way around.
    There are two types of type casting. Type casting only works with primitive
    data types.
    1)Implicit/Auto/Widening
    2)Explicit/Manual/Narrowing
Example
    int number=(int)10.5

if statements
    if statements are part of the conditional construct in Java. They help us
    write code that can be executed based on condition.
    There are many variations of if statements 1) if 2) if-else 3) else-if
    4) Nested if
Why do we need conditional statements?
    Without the if statements programs will always generate the same output
    no matter what.
Syntax:
    if(Condition){
    Something that we want to execute if the condition is true
    }else{
    Something that we want to execute if the condition is false
    }

Note:
1) Whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if conditions
always go with else-if statement
2) With primitive data types we can use > < == != etc.
but with non primitives we have to use the equals method. (.equals)
