Logical Operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions on the same line in if
    statements. There are three types of logical operators. NOT(!) OR(||)
    AND(&&)
NOT(!):
    True=>false
    False=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
    1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
    2) Code readability will increase.
OR(||)
    Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way
    that as soon as one condition is true the whole condition will be
    evaluated as true.
true||false||true=>true

AND(&&)
    Logical and Operator will help us combine the conditions in such a way
    that it will only gve us ture if all the conditions are true.
true && false && true=>false
ture && true && true=>true
true && true && false=>false
