Arrays:
    Arrays are data structures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing [] to manipulate data inside them. Indexes always starts from 0.

Why should we use arrays?
    Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily with the help of loops.
    Whenever we have more than three similar items that we want to store and process together
    we should always go with arrays.

Syntax:
There are two ways of creating the arrays
     Method1:
     DataType[] nameOfTheArray={element1,element2,element3}
     Method2:
     DataType[] nameOfTheArray= new DataType[Size];

Enhanced for Loop:
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through data structures which have multiple
    items stored inside them.

Why should we use Enhanced For Loop:
    It's simple and easy to understand.

Syntax:
    for(DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure){

    }

Limitations of Enhanced For Loops:
    1) Enhanced for loop can't be used for updating elements.
    2) Access the elements in reverse order etc.

Break:
    Break keyword is used in switch cases statements and with the loops
    to terminate the loops prematurely.

Why should we use the break keyword:
    Using break keyword can help save a lot of processing time and our code can
    execute faster.

Continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop once we hit the skip keyword
    java ignores the rest of the code in the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
