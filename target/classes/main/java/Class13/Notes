Types of variables:
    There are three types of variables. Local, instance, and static.

Local variables:
    local variables are the variables which are created/declared inside a block of code. Like if else condition,
    loop, switch statements, methods are a block of code.
Upside:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. As soon as java is done
    executing that block of code they are removed from the memory.
Downside:
    They can only be accessed within the block of code they are created.


Instance variables:
    Instance variables are the variables which are created outside of the blocks of codes (if else, switch statements,
    or methods, etc) but inside a class.
Upside:
    They can be accessed anywhere within that class.
Downside:
    They are created when an object of the class is created and they will stay in the memory as long as
    that object is in the memory weather you use them or not.


Static variables:
    Static variables are created inside a class but outside of a block with a static keyword.
Upside:
    They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility. We don't even need to create
    the object of the class in which they are created. We can simply write the name of the class and we can access it.
Downside:
    Static variables occupy the memory for the longest of all.
    They are created even though you don't create any object of that class.



Local vs Instance:
    Whenever it is possible go and create local variables. Only go with instance variables when
    you can't solve a problem with local variables.


Uses of types of variables:
    Local:
        Whenever we are solving any problem many times we need local variables to temporarily store data.
        In all of those cases you should be going with local variables.




Note:
    we will do a little bit of StringBuilder
    we will discuss Thread safety StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
    one example for methods as well
